The Upkeepify plugin includes a shortcode `[upkeepify_task_form]` that you can add to any page or post to display a form for submitting new maintenance tasks.

This shortcode generates a form with the following fields:
- Task Title
- Task Description
- Task Category (dropdown)
- Task Type (dropdown)
- Upload Photo
- GPS Location (auto-filled if user allows location access)
- Math Captcha (for spam prevention)

When a user submits the form, a new "Maintenance Task" post is created with the provided details. Administrators can then manage and assign these tasks to appropriate service providers.
